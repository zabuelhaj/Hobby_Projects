### [Sweet Roll](https://github.com/zabuelhaj/Hobby_Projects/tree/master/Sweet_Roll) ###  
My current project is a self-balancing board for pastry deliveries.  

Picture this:  
You're a baker who makes custom orders for clients. Small items in large quantities, large items in small quantities. You need to deliver them unscathed to your destination, but driving is a gamble. Left turns, right turns, abrupt stops, take-overs on the highway; what happens on the road is unpredictable. Oh no, you took a left turn too hard and now your macarons are all over the floor. You wish you were Takumi Fujiwara. Well, the good news is that shouldn't be a problem; Sweet Roll is here to help. Simply strap it down in your car and Sweet Roll will adjust in relation to your car's G-forces to keep your sweets safe.  

Progress:  
I've currently only done an initial commit of a Python script. My first goal is to set-up an interface between this script and a microcontroller unit, so that I can read and plot live IMU data to characterize for the device.  
I will continue updating anything of importance in this README.
